You will download data from the SSCC server to your local computer, create relational database tables that you'll store locally, create a \"flat\" file with selected customers and variables, and report on purchasing by gender.  You'll document your work by providing your commented code.  You'll save the new assets you created for future use and for sharing with others.\n",
